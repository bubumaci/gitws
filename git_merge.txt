Suppose you’ve decided that your issue fix is complete and ready to be merged into your master branch. 
In order to do that, you’ll merge your issue branch into master.
All you have to do is check out the branch you wish to merge into and then run the git merge command.

You can take the patch of the issue that was fixed and reapply it on top of master. 
In Git, this is called rebasing. 
With the rebase command, you can take all the changes that were committed on one branch 
and replay them on a different branch.
