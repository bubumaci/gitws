To merge branches locally, use git checkout to switch to the branch you want to merge into. This branch is typically the main branch. Next, use git merge and specify the name of the other branch to bring into this branch. This example merges the jeff/feature1 branch into the main branch


rebase:
    Open your feature branch in the terminal: git checkout my-feature-branch.
    Checkout a new branch from it: git checkout -b my-feature-branch-backup.
    Go back to your original branch: git checkout my-feature-branch.
