HOW TO MERGE

git checkout -b "new branch"
git add "file"
git commit -m "commit"
git push --set-upstream origin "new branch"
git switch main
git merge "new branch"


REBASE

The only differences between a rebase and a merge are:

    The resulting tree structure of the history (generally only noticeable when looking at a commit graph) is different (one will have branches, the other won't).
    Merge will generally create an extra commit (e.g. node in the tree).
    Merge and rebase will handle conflicts differently. Rebase will present conflicts one commit at a time where merge will present them all at once.

So the short answer is to pick rebase or merge based on what you want your history to look like.
