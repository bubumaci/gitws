To do a merge (locally), git checkout the branch you want to merge INTO.
Then type git merge <branch> where <branch> is the branch you want to merge FROM.

Rebasing is the process of moving or combining a sequence of commits to a new base commit.
Rebasing is most useful and easily visualized in the context of a feature branching workflow.
