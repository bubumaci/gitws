git merge blabla - check on google

The git merge command will merge any changes that were made to the code base on a separate branch
to your current branch as a new commit.

Syntax:
git merge BRANCH-NAME

rebasing - the same, google is your friend
Rebasing a branch in Git is a way to move the entirety of a branch to another point in the tree.
The simplest example is moving a branch further up in the tree.
To rebase, make sure you have all the commits you want in the rebase in your master branch.
