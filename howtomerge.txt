To merge branches locally, use git checkoutto switch to the branch you want to merge into. This branch is typically the main branch. Next, use git mergeand specify the name of the other branch to bring into this branch. This example merges the jeff/feature1 branch into the main branch.

Rebasing is the process of moving or combining a sequence of commits to a new base commit. Rebasing is most useful and easily visualized in the context of a feature branching workflow.
