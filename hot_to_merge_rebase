Merging Branches in a Local Repository
To merge branches locally, use git checkout to switch to the branch you want to merge into. This branch is typically the main branch. Next, use git mergeand specify the name of the other branch to bring into this branch.

git checkout main
git merge <branch>

Merging Branches to Remote Repository
If you create a branch in your local repository, the remote repository is not aware of the branchâ€™s existence. Before you can push the branch code in the remote repository, you set the remote repository as the upstream branch using the git pushcommand. This command simultaneously sets the upstream branch and pushes the branch contents to the remote repository.

git push --set-upstream origin <branch name>

Merging Main into a Branch
While you are working on your branch, other developers may update the main branch with their branch. This action means your branch is now out of date of the main branch and missing content. You can merge the main branch into your branch by checking out your branch and using the same git merge command.

git checkout <branch name>
git merge main

Git Rebase
Rebasing a branch in Git is a way to move the entirety of a branch to another point in the tree. The simplest example is moving a branch further up in the tree.
To rebase, make sure you have all the commits you want in the rebase in your master branch. Check out the branch you want to rebase and type git rebase master (where master is the branch you want to rebase on).

git rebase master
